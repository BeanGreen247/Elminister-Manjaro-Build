# Elminister-Manjaro-Build
My Manjaro Linux Build for my Elminister rig

### Step 0

Get Manjaro Linux ISO file, I picked the KDE version

https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/

Burn ISO to USB drive

Balena Etcher - https://www.balena.io/etcher/

dd - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html

Once done go into your BIOS and change boot priority to make sure that the usb drive is the first option. Then save and exit.

SUGGESTION >>> UNPLUG DRIVES THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO INSTALL LINUX TO.
